# Multi-Agent Systems for Task Management in a City

## Project Description:
The project aims to create a multi-agent system where two teams of robots navigate through a 2D city. Each team's goal is to earn as much money as possible by completing specific tasks, such as acquiring and transporting goods. Tasks can be generated by the system or by one of the teams, and they can be of two types: simple tasks (first-come, first-served) or auction-based tasks.

Each team needs to make decisions regarding the tasks to be accomplished, required resources, and navigation in the city, considering targets such as stores, warehouses, charging stations, and more. The teams consist of different types of agents with specific characteristics, such as movement speed, chosen movement algorithm (random, A*, memorized path, etc.), battery charge, and cargo capacity.

Agents also need to manage their battery charge by planning visits to recharge stations to avoid running out of power during their movements. Tournament points are distributed based on the accumulated rewards of each team. To earn more points, a team must surpass a certain threshold and outperform the other team. Points can be deducted for significant debts.

## Project Goal:
The goal of the project is to develop the agents, their environment, and the overall management of the system. Initially, the project will focus on single-agent teams where robots move randomly. Later, intelligent behaviors will be added to the agents to optimize their movements.

## Project Instruction:
-Use the Python programming language with the Tkinter library for the graphical interface.

-Work in groups of 3 or 4 students.

-Produce an analysis and design report including use case and class diagrams.

-Utilize an Agile project management methodology.

-Provide a programming report describing the progress, improvements made, and tests conducted.

-Prepare a project management report containing the planned and actual schedules, task allocation, version control solution, performed tests, and a personal assessment.

-The project evaluation will be based on 15 points for the reports and the developed solution.

-An additional score of up to 5 points will be given for any original ideas integrated into the system and the visual quality of the simulation.

## Remarks:
The project supervisor acts as the "client" and will assist with UML and Python but does not direct the work.
There are multiple ways to approach the proposed project, and each group will build their system based on their perspective, which they should justify in their reports and presentations.
